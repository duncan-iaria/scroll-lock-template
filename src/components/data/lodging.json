            "description": "Lake Rabun Hotel & Restaurant celebrated its 90th birthday in 2012. It’s the last surviving mountain lodge on a lake in Georgia. Because it has stayed true to the look and the feeling of another, perhaps more peaceful, time, it’s been called both a regional and a national treasure.  For decades generations have enjoyed the beauty of the lake and mountains. Carefully restored by preservationists in 2008 to maintain its ancestral charm, it features gardens of native plants, rock pillars and walkways, locust log decks, and balconies with views of the surrounding Blue Ridge Mountains. Lake Rabun is one of the most beautiful lakes in the mountains of North Georgia.",
